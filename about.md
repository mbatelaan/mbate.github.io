title: About Me
---

I am Mischa Batelaan, a postdoctoral researcher at the College of William and Mary. My research is focused on hadron spectroscopy in lattice QCD.
Outside of research I like to spend my time cycling around the Adelaide area and competing in local amateur cycling races. I also enjoy playing around with computers and technology.

### Introduction
- I have been a PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide since 2019 working under the supervision of Associate professor James Zanotti and Associate professor Ross Young.
- I received my honours degree in Bachelors of Science in High Performance Computational Physics from the University of Adelaide in 2018. My thesis title was _"Nucleon Form Factor Calculations using the Feynman-Hellmann method"_
