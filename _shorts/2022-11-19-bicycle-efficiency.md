One of my favourite graphs is the one below, showing the efficiency of various modes of transport and animals.

Note that both the axes are on a log scale.
It is truly amazing how efficient a bicycle can make us.
Comparing bicycles to cars makes it obvious to me that the best way to design our cities for sustainability reasons is to prioritize bicycle traffic everywhere.
If only traffic engineers could come to the same conclusions.

This plot does not have electric bicycles or cars on it but I think it would be safe to assume that the difference between electric bikes and electric cars is still very much in favour of bikes.
I do have hope that with the increasing popularity of electric bikes, city design will shift towards prioritizing this more efficient mode of transport.
