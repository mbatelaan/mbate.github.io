- [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) is a cool idea encouraging people to write more blog posts. I will aim to complete this in the following year. Will keep you updated.
  I also looked through their list of blogs who have completed it and here are a few fun ones:
  - [https://bluelander.bearblog.dev](https://bluelander.bearblog.dev)
  - [https://joelchrono12.xyz](https://joelchrono12.xyz)
- A good [blog post](https://mattlakeman.org/2022/11/22/notes-on-saudi-arabia/#more-1640) about Saudi Arabia.
- I had assumed that the Saudi plan to build [The Line](https://www.dezeen.com/2022/10/19/line-megacity-under-construction-saudi-arabia-drone/) would not really get off the ground but it looks like they are going ahead with it.
- [Nice plot](https://twitter.com/ZWheelz/status/1597661710487552000) showing the different battery sizes for different electric vehicles. This makes it clear how beneficial more cycling infrastructure would be for the environment.
- [An insightful blog post](https://blog.nateliason.com/p/de-atomization-is-the-secret-to-happiness) about the tendency towards atomization in our modern world. I very much like the idea of trying to integrate as many activities into the full context of life as possible.
- I've been reading about ergotism and its psychoactive effects. I found some links suggesting it could have played a role in historical events such as the [Viking invasion of France](https://www.mashed.com/26985/foods-actually-mess-head/) and the [Salem witchcraft accusations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergotism), no references for the first claim however, so take it with a grain of salt.
- [Good post and video on programming documentation](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/) and how github can be used to complement code documentation by keeping a record of all issues and their fixes.
