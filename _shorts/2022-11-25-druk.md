Druk is a Danish film by director Thomas Vinterberg starring Mads Mikkelsen. The film starts with a quote from SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard:
>What is youth?  
>A dream.  
>What is Love?  
>The dream's content.  

The film tells the story of four high school teachers who decide to embark on an experiment in which they explore the full spectrum of alcohol use. The main character, Martin is a history teacher who has trouble with his class of seniors who complain that they do not trust him to adequately prepare them for the final exams that year. His teaching style is very erratic and he shows no enthusiasm for the content at all. After a birthday dinner with the other three theachers where Martin vents his worries and anxieties about the state of his life, the group of four decide to embark on an experiment. The motivation for the experiment comes from an idea by a philosopher that humans are born with a blood alcohol content that is 0.05 too low.

The idea of the experiment is that they will drink throughout the work day to keep their BAC at 0.05, but at the same time they will restrict their drinking to working hours. The aim is to extract the useful effects of alcohol in terms of its reduction of social inhibitions and the reduced anxiety. Martin immediately notices improvements in his teaching as he engages a lot more with the students and the content of his lessons. The other teachers also show changes in their teaching style as they get more creative and open to trying new things. As the group becomes more excited some decide to increase the level of alcohol to get even more out of it. From this point on it starts to deteriorate as they start losing control over their alcohol use, each in their own way.

I think this film is a beautiful exploration of our human desire to escape from ourselves at times. We are all incredible good at thinking complex and emotionally laden thoughts about any situation in our lives. However this skill can very easily drag us down into one of many spirals which are very hard to get out of. Alcohol allows us to temporarily dispense with many of those inhibitions and self-imposed limitations. It is wonderful in a way how it allows us to explore so much more of ourselves and the social world around us, by breaking down barriers which we ourselves have put up. The film also shows how it is a dangerous line to walk however, each use of alcohol moves us a little bit closer to dependency, which can easily put us into a much much worse state.

The desire to explore life without those inhibitions is why so many young people are drawn to alcohol.
Many of them are taught valuable life lessons through the use or abuse of alcohol.
As the story of Martin shows, alcohol can be a catalyst in life, but the real change will always come from our relationships with the people around us. The change in Martin's life by the end of the films is very much due to his shared experiences with his friends, and alcohol was the catalyst that allowed them to happen. As Kierkegaard says, the deepest emotions are sometimes found in a dream of youth.
