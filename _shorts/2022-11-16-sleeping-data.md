I have been tracking my sleep with the Amazfit Bip S for quite a while now. Exporting the data from their app has allowed me to make a nice visualization of the length of time I sleep each night and how it changes with time.

A possible way to interpret this data is to look at the 7 day rolling average and compare this to a normal range. The normal range I chose here is to take the rolling average of the last sixty days and take half a standard deviation over that time period on either side of the average.

Using this method, the week-long rolling average seems to stay within my normal range at all times, but sometimes it gets quite close to the edge. I think this is a good way of quantifying abnormalities in my sleeping. If the graph shows my 7-day rolling average to be outside the normal range, then I know that my sleeping habits have probably changed too quickly.

Once I have more data available, I would be interested to know if I can pick out any seasonal effects on my sleep time.
