I have been reading the book *Burn* by Herman Pontzer, in the section I just finished he talked about his experiences living with the Hadza tribe in Tanzania. He mentions that one of the most common phrases the Hadza use is:

> Hamna Shida

This is the Hadza words for 'no problem'. This is used to illustrate how in the Hadza tribe, the default behaviour is to share everything. This default mode is so ingrained that they do not use any words such as "please" or "thank you", these are unnecessary when the default behaviour is sharing.
He then relates this back to our evolutionary past and to the theory that this ability to share is what gave our ancestors such a large advantage over other primates. The tendency to share allowed them to devote more energy to riskier endeavours which payed off in the long term.

This was a new idea to me and it certainly has a charm to it which makes it very easy to believe. It also made me reflect on the many situations in my own life where my default behaviour is not to share, but where it definitely could (and should) be. A powerful reminder that sharing makes us stronger together.
