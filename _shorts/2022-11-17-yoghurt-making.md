# Notes on yoghurt making

I have been eating a lot of yoghurt lately, so I thought it would be good if I looked into getting a yoghurt maker to make the yoghurt myself. Looking ove the pricing of it:
- The cheapest Greek yoghurt I can buy is $3.70/kg
- full cream milk is around $1.60 per litre
- Some liquid will be lost in the yoghurt making process, so round to $2 per litre of home-made yoghurt
This seems like a pretty good way to save some money and have some fun with experimenting with different methods and milks.

The yoghurt maker I bought is the Flora yoghurt maker with a capacity of 2L. I decided to go for an electric one instead of the type that only uses hot water. The electric yoghurt maker should make it easier to make consistent yoghurt and I do think electric ones are better suited for larger volumes of yoghurt. 2 litres should be enough to get good value out of it such that I don't have to use it too frequently.

The first batch I made was around 1.2 litres, made from fresh full cream milk and 5% Greek yoghurt by weight. I left the yoghurt maker on for 11 hours. The result tasted quite good, the yoghurt was a bit runny as the whey is still mixed in it. Next time I will use the strainer to try and make Greek yoghurt. Another helpful tip I found says that using powdered milk will thicken the yoghurt so I'll try that as well.
