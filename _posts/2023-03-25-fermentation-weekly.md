# Kohlarabi & Carrot Ferment
Things I learned:
- Using a slice of kohlrabi works well to keep the rest submerged

# Sauerkraut
Things I learned:
- Controlling the headspace atmosphere is more important than keeping everything submerged
- Massaging the salt into the cabbage helps break down some of the structure and will release more liquids

pushing it all into the jar, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the jar after 3 days.

# Mead
Things I learned:
- Exposing the mead to too much oxygen later on in the process (once alcohol has started forming) may produce vinegar
- Mead fermentation will be more vigorous when adding nutrients besides the sugar, easy ones are:
  - Raisins and other fruits
  - Boiled (dead) bakers yeast

# Sourdough Bread
Things I learned:
- The bread will rise better if a lot of steam is present in the oven
- The scoring cut can be quite deep
- More rounds of stretching and kneading will give it a better structure

# Banana Ketchup
Almost at two weeks now, it is still bubbling vigorously. The lid on the jar leaks slightly, so this is acting as my airlock.
