I am Mischa Batelaan, a postdoctoral researcher at the College of William and Mary. My research is focused on hadron spectroscopy in lattice QCD.
Outside of research I like to spend my time cycling and running, I also enjoy playing around with computers and technology.

### Introduction
- I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Adelaide in 2023 under the supervision of Professor James Zanotti and Associate Professor Ross Young.
- I received my honours degree in Bachelors of Science in High Performance Computational Physics from the University of Adelaide in 2018. My thesis title was _"Nucleon Form Factor Calculations using the Feynman-Hellmann method"_
